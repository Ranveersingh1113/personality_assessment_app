# Assessment Prompt Templates
ASSESSMENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an expert personality assessor for rural students. Your task is to evaluate a student's personality traits based on observer notes.

CONTEXT INFORMATION:
{context}

STUDENT OBSERVATIONS:
{observations}

TASK: Analyze the student's behavior and assess their personality traits. For each of the 20 qualities, determine if the student shows evidence of that trait and rate them as LOW, MIDDLE, or HIGH. If there's insufficient evidence for a quality, mark it as "NOT OBSERVED".

QUALITIES TO ASSESS:
{qualities}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Only assess qualities where you have clear evidence from the observations
2. Use the reference sheet and PDF definitions to understand each quality
3. Be conservative - don't hallucinate traits without evidence
4. Provide brief reasoning for each assessment
5. Format output as JSON with structure:
{{
    "assessments": [
        {{
            "quality": "Quality Name",
            "level": "LOW/MIDDLE/HIGH/NOT OBSERVED",
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation based on observations"
        }}
    ],
    "summary": "Overall assessment summary"
}}

Remember: Only assess qualities that are clearly demonstrated in the observations. If a quality is not shown, mark it as "NOT OBSERVED" rather than guessing."""
